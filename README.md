Predicting occurrence of diabetes using machine learning algorithms on two different Diabetes Datasets\
First performed exploratory data analysis on two different datasets related to diabetes and then applying different ML algorithms on both the datasets for the sake of predicting whether a given individual is diabetic or not.\
The ML algorithms were trained on different independent parameters/features present in the two datasets. The datasets also differ in their shape.\
Further performing a comparative analysis of the ML algorithms used on the basis of accuracy, F1 - score, precision, recall and AUC and selected the best among all the ML algorithms.
